# DBA Bridge

> Know exactly what will break before you migrate.

**DBA Bridge** is a free, open source desktop application for database migration.  
It scans your legacy database and produces a detailed audit report of every incompatibility, risky stored procedure, data type mismatch, and foreign key issue — **before you touch production.**

Download it. Open it. Connect your database. Get a report in minutes.  
No cloud account. No command line. No configuration files. Works like DBeaver.

## The Problem

Every major migration tool — AWS DMS, Azure Migrate, ora2pg — reports success based on row counts.  
They don't check stored procedures. They don't flag data type edge cases. They don't handle FK constraint ordering.  
Your app breaks after cutover. There is no report. No explanation. No evidence pack. Just a log file and a missed deadline.

**DBA Bridge fixes this.**

---

## Features

### Available at Launch
- **Pre-Migration Audit Report** — scans every table, column, stored procedure, trigger, index, sequence, and constraint. Outputs risk score (Low / Medium / High / Critical), FK dependency graph, and estimated migration time. HTML + PDF output.
- **Data Type Mapping Engine** — rules-based mapping for every Oracle and SQL Server type to Postgres equivalents. Handles edge cases: Oracle `DATE` includes time, `NUMBER` precision, `NVARCHAR` collation differences, `BLOB` → `BYTEA`.
- **FK Dependency Graph** — calculates correct table migration order using topological sort. Detects circular dependencies. Re-enables constraints in the correct sequence after data load.
- **Stored Procedure Rewriter** — rewrites Oracle PL/SQL and SQL Server T-SQL to Postgres PL/pgSQL. Side-by-side diff with confidence score per line. You approve every change. Runs locally via Ollama — code never leaves your machine.
- **Index & Trigger Analysis** — flags function-based indexes, bitmap indexes, and incompatible triggers with specific recommended actions per object.
- **Post-Migration Validation Report** — compares source and target after migration: row counts, null distributions, constraint status, index presence, sequence values, synthetic query diff. Per-table 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 output.
- **Manual Script Validation** — validate your own SQL migration scripts for errors and incompatibilities before running them.
- **Local AI via Ollama** — stored procedure rewriting runs fully offline. GDPR-safe. Air-gap compatible. No API key needed.
- **Cloud AI via multimind.dev** — optional hosted AI for faster processing on large procedure sets. No Ollama install required.
- **Desktop App (Mac / Windows / Linux)** — native app built with Tauri. Download and run like DBeaver. No cloud account. No terminal.

### Coming in Phase 2
- **Dry Run Mode** — simulate the full migration against a read-only source. Shows every error that would occur without touching production.
- **Migration Health Dashboard** — visual per-table progress, throughput metrics, exportable PDF for stakeholders.
- **Schema Version Control** — save schema snapshots before and after migration, diff two snapshots, generate rollback instructions.
- **MySQL / MariaDB source support**

### Coming in Phase 3
- **NoSQL → SQL migration** — MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra → PostgreSQL / Supabase. Schema inference, document flattening, composite key mapping.
- **Cloud warehouse targets** — Snowflake and BigQuery as migration targets. Stored procedures rewritten as dbt models.
- **Incremental / CDC mode** — keep source and target in sync during cutover window. Eliminates downtime for large databases.
- **Open Source Connector SDK** — build and publish community connectors via PyPI.

### Coming in Phase 4
- **PII Detection + Data Masking** — auto-detects email, SSN, credit card, phone, passport columns. Masking options: pseudonymisation, tokenisation, redaction, hashing. GDPR / HIPAA / CCPA / PCI DSS.
- **ORM Compatibility Checker** — scans target schema for patterns that break Hibernate, SQLAlchemy, Prisma, ActiveRecord, GORM, TypeORM.
- **Compliance Report Generator** — signed PDF audit trail for regulators. Proves data completeness, integrity, PII handling, and sign-off chain.
- **Blue / Green Migration Mode** — migrate to a standby database while production stays live. CDC sync. One-click cutover. Instant rollback.
- **Migration Planner AI** — upload a schema, receive a full migration plan with risk scores, time estimates, and recommended approach in under 60 seconds.
- **Migration Knowledge Graph** — every approved stored procedure rewrite trains a local knowledge base. The rewriter gets smarter with every migration.
- **Team Collaboration** — role-based access, audit log, comment threads on AI suggestions, approval workflows.
- **Self-Hosted Enterprise** — Docker / Kubernetes, air-gapped, bring your own LLM.

## What It Does

### 1. Pre-Migration Audit Report

Connect DBA Bridge to your source database (read-only — nothing is modified).  
It scans every table, column, stored procedure, trigger, index, sequence, and constraint.  
Outputs a structured HTML or PDF report you can hand to your team before migration starts.

**The report tells you:**
- Which stored procedures are clean, which need rewriting, which have no equivalent
- Every column with a risky data type conversion (Oracle `DATE` → `TIMESTAMP`, `NUMBER` precision loss, `NVARCHAR` collation differences)
- The correct table migration order based on foreign key dependencies
- Circular FK dependencies and how to resolve them
- Overall risk score: **Low / Medium / High / Critical**
- Estimated migration time per table

---

### 2. Stored Procedure Rewriter

DBA Bridge automatically rewrites Oracle PL/SQL and SQL Server T-SQL to Postgres PL/pgSQL.  
Shows a **side-by-side diff** with a confidence score per line.  
You review and approve every change before anything is applied.

Runs locally on your machine using [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — your code never leaves your network.  
Optional: connect to [multimind.dev](https://multimind.dev) cloud AI for faster processing on large procedure sets.

**Supported rewrites:**

| Oracle / SQL Server | Postgres |
|---------------------|---------|
| Oracle `PL/SQL` | `PL/pgSQL` |
| SQL Server `T-SQL` | `PL/pgSQL` |
| `ROWNUM` | `LIMIT / OFFSET` |
| `NVL()` | `COALESCE()` |
| `DECODE()` | `CASE WHEN` |
| `CONNECT BY` (hierarchical queries) | Recursive CTEs |
| Oracle `DUAL` table references | Removed / rewritten |
| SQL Server `TOP` | `LIMIT` |
| Oracle `SEQUENCE` | `SERIAL` / `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` |
| `ISNULL()` | `COALESCE()` |
| `MINUS` | `EXCEPT` |

---

### 3. Post-Migration Validation Report

After migration completes, DBA Bridge compares source and target automatically.

**Checks performed:**
- Row counts per table (source vs target must match)
- Null distribution per column
- All FK, PK, and UNIQUE constraints enabled and valid
- All indexes recreated
- Stored procedure count matches
- Sequence values at correct next position
- Sample queries run against both databases — results are diffed

**Output:**
- Per-table status: 🟢 Green / 🟡 Amber / 🔴 Red
- Summary: *"Migration is 94% validated. 3 issues found. 2 are warnings, 1 requires action."*
- Specific actionable errors with root cause explanation

## Supported Migration Pairs

| Source | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Oracle | PostgreSQL | ✅ Phase 1 |
| SQL Server | Supabase | ✅ Phase 1 |
| MySQL / MariaDB | PostgreSQL | 🔜 Phase 2 |
| MongoDB | PostgreSQL | 🔜 Phase 3 |
| DynamoDB | PostgreSQL / Supabase | 🔜 Phase 3 |
| Any relational | Snowflake / BigQuery | 🔜 Phase 3 |

---

## How It Works

**1. Connect your source database**  
Enter your connection details. DBA Bridge connects read-only — it cannot modify your source database.

**2. Run the Audit**  
Click "Run Audit." DBA Bridge scans the entire schema and generates your pre-migration report in minutes.

**3. Review stored procedure rewrites**  
For each stored procedure, see the original and rewritten version side by side. Approve, edit, or skip each one.

**4. Configure and run the migration**  
Select which tables to migrate, set batch sizes, choose migration order (or use the recommended order from the FK graph). Click Run.

**5. Review the Validation Report**  
After migration, run validation. Get a traffic-light report proving every table migrated correctly.
